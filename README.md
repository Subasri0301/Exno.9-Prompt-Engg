## **Aim:**

To generate a high-quality, realistic HD video  using AI-based video generation tools and analyze the output based on prompt efficiency and realism.

---

## AI Video Generation Tool:
Bing Video Creator (Sora)

---

## **Prompt Used:**

**“Create a realistic HD video of light rain falling on a quiet street surrounded by trees. Add real-world reflections on the wet road, soft raindrop splashes, moving clouds, and natural gray lighting. Camera slowly pans sideways, capturing the calm and natural atmosphere.”**

---

## **Procedure:**

1. Open **Bing Video Creator (Sora)** in a web browser.
2. Log in using a Microsoft account to access video generation features.
3. Navigate to the **Video Generation** section.
4. Enter the above prompt in the prompt textbox.
5. Select the following settings (if available):

   * **Quality:** HD
   * **Style:** Realistic
   * **Camera Movement:** Slow pan
   * **Duration:** Default / AI-generated
6. Submit the prompt and wait for the tool to process the video.
7. Download and preview the generated video.
8. Note down the visual quality, realism, weather effects, lighting accuracy, and fluid motion.
9. Compare the result with the intended scene for accuracy.

## **Observations:**

1. The generated video displayed **natural light rain**, with clear droplet splashes on the ground.
2. The **wet road reflections** were realistic and followed real-world lighting behavior.
3. The **camera panning motion** was smooth, giving a cinematic feel.
4. **Tree movement** and environmental details matched natural windy/rainy conditions.
5. The overall atmosphere appeared calm, soft, and visually consistent.
6. Minor AI artifacts may appear near edges of trees or moving clouds (typical for generative video).

## **Calculations:**



| Parameter       | Expected             | Observed | Accuracy |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Realism         | High                 | High     | ~95%     |
| Lighting        | Natural gray         | Achieved | ~90%     |
| Reflections     | Smooth and clear     | Achieved | ~95%     |
| Camera Motion   | Slow pan             | Achieved | 100%     |
| Weather Effects | Light rain, splashes | Achieved | ~95%     |

*(Accuracy is an approximate qualitative comparison based on visual inspection.)*

## **Conclusion:**

AI-based video generation using **Bing Video Creator (Sora)** successfully produced a realistic HD rain scene based on the provided prompt. The generated video displayed high clarity, natural motion, realistic reflections, and accurate lighting. This experiment demonstrates how effective prompting techniques directly influence the quality and realism of AI-generated videos.
